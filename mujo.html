                    <b>Theme: Healthy Lifestyle Experience</b>
                    <br>
                    Your challenge is to build an experience that helps people be more 
                    conscious about their health and to promote healthy living. A healthy lifestyle can mean physical 
                    health and/or mental health.

                    <label>1. Researching & identifying the problem</label>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            After a while of brainstorming and thinking of ideas that instinctively came to me upon reading the 
                            description of this challenge, I eventually thought of taking a different approach as to how I planned 
                            on building an experience that increases awareness and consciousness of personal and mental health. 
                            Rather than a direct approach to promote the importance of physical and mental health, such as the 
                            examples listed in the challenge (workout apps, food tracker, meditation apps, etc.), I decided to 
                            take a rather indirect one and chose to design a more thoughtful experience for people that allows them 
                            to focus on mental health by keeping track of their moods and thoughts - something that is rather difficult 
                            to quantify - in the form of journal entries. The idea of keeping a mood journal helps 
                            people become more aware self-aware as it's an easy way of keeping track of and identifying mood patterns as a result 
                            of events going on in their lives that can cause sudden shifts.

                            <div class="heading">Issues that currently exist with the journaling method</div>
                            While keeping a mood journal is an extremely useful tool to improve one’s mental health and well-being, it's not
                            something that has picked up and there are a lot of issues that personally I, and hopefully many others face when
                            attempting to committ journaling my thoughts and feelings for purposes of self-awareness and self-reflection.

                                <li><b>Inconvenience</b>: Carrying a journal around and writing down things the moment they occurr is not always possible.</li>
                                <li><b>Difficult to quantify data</b>: It's difficult to quantify feelings and thoughts in a way that allows people to analyze and look at the bigger pictures. </li>
                                <li><b>Taboo</b>: Keeping journals is thought to be a “girly” concept, which unnecessarily feminizes this notion and makes it taboo for boys and men to do the same.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <blockquote><b>Digitize the mood journal.</b></blockquote>
                            The idea of this experience is to not only allow for a quick and convenient way of writing journal entries, but 
                            also it enables an easier way of quantifying data that is otherwise very hard to measure if not kept track of. 
                            In addition, a mood journal experience will allow people to improve their well-being by overseeing the ways their 
                            mood changes and what kinds of triggers cause these shifts. Digitizing the concept of a mood journal makes it very quick 
                            and convenient for people to write down their thoughts the moment they occur, eliminates the taboo against the journaling and
                            expressing one's thoughts and emotions (especially men and boys), and offers valuable statistics and data that people can use to
                            help make better decisions or become more self-aware.

                    <label>2. Developing a user flow</label>
                        <p>
                            I wanted this flow to be as simple as possible for a user to quickly write down and express their thoughts, yet highly informative and helpful for 
                            people when they look back and re-read their entries. Not only does adding additional information it give context to users as they re-read their 
                            entries, but it gives a way of easily making calculations and allowing them to identify relationships and patterns between having certain feelings, 
                            the way they deal with it, and how their health levels coincide. 
                            <blockquote>The idea of digitizing the mood journaling flow is to make things quick as well as easy to quantify data.</blockquote>

                        <label>3. Creating wireframes</label>
                        <p>
                            Due to time constraints, I quickly created some high-level wireframes that outlined and demonstrated what the overall layout of my mood journaling app would be
                            and what features it would contain. 
                            <br>During this part of the process I made the following design decisions:
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>A monthly calendar view</b>: Viewing your entries in a calendar view makes it easier for people to see overall changes</li>
                                <li><b>Prompt giver for writing entries</b>: Helps in situations where the person doesn't know where to begin writing or how to express what they're feeling.</li>
                                <li><b>Personalized statistics</b>: Helps people identify areas they struggle or succeed as well as gives a better understanding
                                    of overall mood patterns the person has experienced in the past </li>
                                <li><b>Visual aids</b>: Using icons to express feelings & emotions</li>
                                <li><b>Colour association</b>: Associating certain colours to specific mood and feelings to evoke certain emotional responses that may make it easier for people to express their thoughts. <b>Colour pyschology 101!</b> </li>

                        <label>4. Producing high-fidelity mock-up & prototype</label>
                        <p>
                            Because I became very invested in this project by the time I submitted my application, I decided to spend some extra hours creating a high-fidelity mock up
                            on AdobeXD. In this part of the process, I carefully thought about everything from typography and colour schemes to detailed UI design and transitions.
